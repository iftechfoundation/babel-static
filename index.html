<h2>The Treaty of Babel: Software and a standard for IF bibliography</h2>

<p>Since the 1980s, writers of interactive fiction have used a
variety of programs to create new works. Some were
in-house tools used by commercial IF production houses, but from
around 1990 IF has been written by a diverse Internet community, using
tools written, tested and evolved within the community.
 With few exceptions,                                   
the virtual machines used by different design systems have been
mutually incompatible.
Although a number of multi-format interpreters
have been written, and the IF community prefers a format-independent
approach to reviewing and discussing works of IF, few tools exist
(as of the start of 2006) which treat all formats equally.</p>

<p>The Treaty is an agreement between active design systems, the
IF-archive and other interested parties. It provides for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ISBN-like unique ID numbers for story files, old and new,
		produced by commercial or non-commercial compilers living
		and dead;
<li>a standard format for cover art and bibliographic data;
<li>a web server able to provide these for a given ID number;
<li>a command-line tool able to identify and extract data from
		story files in any format;
<li>reference software providing a format-neutral API for reading
		story files, and removing "wrappers".
</ul>

<p>The aim of the treaty, and of the Babel software, is to make it much
easier to write new tools for players in which the distinction of which
design system created which story file is much less visible.
